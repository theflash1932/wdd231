            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Greg. I have recently transferred to Pathways / BYU-I from
                Weber State University, pursuing a Software Engineering BS. This is my third
                attempt at a degree. 25 years ago I started at Weber State, then life got busy
                with bills, work, kids, etc. and I didn't finish. 15 years ago I attended Western
                Governors University, then life happened again as I went through a divorce and
                I didn't finish. I started back at Weber State a year and a half ago but then
                decided to transfer to Pathways / BYU because we were struggling to keep up
                with tuition, but it was still important to me to finish.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remarried two years ago to a sweet girl named Kristin and moved to North Salt
                Lake. Kristin has 5 kids - 20, 17, 16, 13, 11. Combined with my 5 kids - 23, 21,
                18, 15, 11 - we make quite the gang lol Kristin is a school counselor at American
                Preparatory Academy in Draper.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an Escalations Engineer for an IT consulting / outsourcing company based in
                Utah called Executech. We provide IT services for organizations that either doesn't
                need "full-time" IT staff or want to augment their IT teams with additional help and
                expertise. For example, two of my clients are Davis County cities where I spend about
                15 hours/wk, and I also spend 5 hours managing IT for a law firm and for a capital
                investment firm in SLC. I am also one of our technical instructors, currently teaching
                server hardware, virtualization, DNS, and Active Directory / Group Policy. The rest of
                the time I spend managing cloud and on-prem projects, as well as troubleshooting and
                fixing hardware/software and network issues escalated to me by our technical teams.
